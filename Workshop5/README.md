This workshop is intended for participants who are interested in both web-design and data visualizations. Previously, the focus was primarily on coding or concepts. This workshop will look at the entire process, from a flat-file data set to an interactive visualization.

This workshop will include what Dudas calls "Human Factor" elements such as working with a client, understanding the intended audience, and designs that fit the problem. This will incorporate concepts in HCI (human-computer interaction), front-end analysis, and iterative design. Dudas will also showcase how to create a basic webpage for the visualization.

By the end of the workshop, participants should have a strong grasp on the complete design "life-cycle" for their own work and research. Participants should have some background in programming or be interested in the design process.
