Computational Essays are a relatively new approach to both showcasing research and creating pedagogical resources for learners. They merge plain text, interactive inputs, and dynamic outputs to help simplify complex subject matter.

In this workshop hosted by Patrick Dudas, data visualization software engineer for life sciences, participants will explore this new medium and develop their own computational essay using a new website: https://beta.observablehq.com.

Participants should have some background in programming; however, this type of programming will be relatively new to most. Patrick will walk participants through an example or two to make sure everyone starts at the same level of design and coding knowledge. No programs are required for downloading.
