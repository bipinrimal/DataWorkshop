Want to gain a larger audience for your research, have a better way to explore and validate data, and have the ability to see your data from different perspectives? Attend the ICS Data Visualization Workshops! This workshop series is for students and researchers who are new to creating data visualizations, tired of Excel's premade templates, enjoy art/design, and want to incorporate real data into their work.

Many of our discussions will be centered on the development of D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) projects, an open-source JavaScript library to create static and dynamic vector graphics (ideal for publications). Beginners are welcome!

At this session, we'll discuss:

Anaconda, a standalone platform to develop all code necessary for the workshop
D3.js, and the kinds of graphics it can produce
A simple scatterplot example to help with getting started on developing further concepts
For this workshop, please download Anaconda (specifically the version for Python 2.7) on your personal laptop. (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Please bring your laptop to the workshop!

Attendees are expected to have very minimal prior coding experience with JavaScript or D3.js. We'll use open-source and free software tools that are easy to install and will let you run all code without external applications or compiling.
