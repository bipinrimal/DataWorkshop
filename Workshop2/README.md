Two of the most requested visualizations will be on display in this workshop: force-directed graphs and maps. We'll be utilizing Anaconda (Jupyter) to create a small NetworkX Python program and D3.js code to generate the visualizations. With the maps, we will be discussing how to translate Shapefiles into vector maps (D3.js) and include raster tilesets as well (via OpenStreetMap and other sources). The workshop will also include a short background section to each of the visualizations to help newcomers understand the terminology and the techniques involved with these designs.

Participants can be new to both Python and D3.js, but should have a basic understanding of code development and be able to create a basic script in a coding languge.

Please bring your laptop and download Anaconda, specifically the version for Python 2.7, (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
